# Jupyter Notebook Execution Guide with Anaconda

This guide explains how to run a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda.

## Prerequisites

1. Anaconda must be installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

## Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Open Anaconda Navigator, the graphical application provided by Anaconda.

2. From the interface, select the environment in which you want to work (for example, the default, called "base (root)").

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator interface.

4. Your default browser should automatically open with the Jupyter interface. If not, you can access the interface by opening your browser and visiting the URL displayed in the console.

5. In the Jupyter interface, locate the notebook file (main `.ipynb`) and open it by clicking on it.

6. Inside the notebook, you can execute cells using the "Run" button or by using the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`.

## Stopping the Jupyter Notebook

1. To stop the Jupyter server, return to the Anaconda Navigator interface and close the terminal associated with the Jupyter Notebook.

2. You can also close the browser tab with the Jupyter interface.

That's it! You should now be able to run and work with Jupyter Notebooks using Anaconda on your local machine.
